      "paper": "Jan 2023",
      "number": 4,
      "question": "Explain why chlorine is a stronger oxidising agent than bromine.",
      "answer": "Chlorine has a higher tendency to gain electrons because it has a smaller atomic radius and stronger attraction between nucleus and incoming electrons.",

    {
      "paper": "Jan 2023",
      "number": 6,
      "question": "Explain why Group 2 metals become more reactive down the group.",
      "answer": "Ionisation energy decreases due to increased shielding and atomic radius, so electrons are lost more easily.",

{
      "paper": "Jan 2023",
      "number": 7,
      "question": "Describe and explain the trend in thermal stability of Group 2 carbonates down the group.",
      "answer": "Thermal stability increases down the group because larger cations have lower charge density and polarise the carbonate ion less.",

      "marks": 3
    },
    {
      "paper": "Jan 2023",
      "number": 8,
      "question": "Explain why the decomposition of Group 2 carbonates requires more heat down the group.",
      "answer": "Carbonates become more thermally stable as cation charge density decreases, so more heat is needed to distort the carbonate ion.",
      "topic": "Group 2",
